## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

This is exploring the IRIS dataset that comes built-in with R. 
```{r iris}
summary(iris)
```

So we can see that the we have 150 observations, 50 each from 3 species, and the dimensions of sepal and petals are recorded. 

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(iris)
```

Here we are looking at a two-way correlation table. As expected, petal length and with correlate highly. 

Additionally, we see clustering in many of the correlation plots. This could indicate that the cluster may be one distinct species. 

We could also compute various statistics manually. For example, 
```{r}
mean(iris$Petal.Width)
```
outputs 1.199, just like in the summary statistics. 

Note that `echo = FALSE` parameter can be added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
